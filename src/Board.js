/** Game board of Lights out.
 *
 * Properties:
 *
 * - nrows: number of rows of board
 * - ncols: number of cols of board
 * - chanceLightStartsOn: float, chance any cell is lit at start of game
 *
 * State:
 *
 * - board: array-of-arrays of true/false
 *
 *    For this board:
 *       .  .  .
 *       O  O  .     (where . is off, and O is on)
 *       .  .  .
 *
 *    This would be: [[f, f, f], [t, t, f], [f, f, f]]
 *
 *  This should render an HTML table of individual <Cell /> components.
 *
 *  This doesn't handle any clicks --- clicks are on individual cells
